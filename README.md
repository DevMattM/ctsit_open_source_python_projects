# ctsit_open_source_projects
This is a convenience repo that will help improve consistency across
our open source projects. We want to encourage open source methodology
and allow our projects to be completely transparent. This will also
set up a basic python project with a simple unit test to help get a
project up and going quickly.

To use, copy all the files out of the `files` directory into the your
new project's directory. Edit each file to match your project in the 
following ways:

# AUTHORS
Give your project a nice preamble and update the list of authors who
have contributed to it. Include middle initial for assurance.

# CHANGELOG.md
This will be used once you have a release. Follow the example in it
and please don't make it a git log dump.

# LICENSE
On the bottom of the file is a copyright year and owner name which need
to be updated with the correct information.

# README.md
Use this file to for instructions, information, and any other things
that would be useful to know when using this software.

# TODO.org
If you have an idea of some of the big picture plans for your project,
start to fill them in here. Follow the examples in the file.
